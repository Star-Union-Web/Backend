## 📁 Branch Overview

| Branch | Project | Description |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **project-1-task-manager** | 🗂️ **Command-Line Task Manager** | A simple command-line task manager that allows adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks, with optional file-saving support. The goal was to practice **Python syntax**, **data handling**, and **basic functions**. |
| **project-2-library-system** | 📚 **Library Management System** | A CLI-based system built using **OOP** principles. It includes `Book` and `Library` classes to manage books — allowing users to add, borrow, and return them, while persisting data with file handling. |
| **project-3-random-api-fetch** | 🌐 **Random API Fetcher** | A project that fetches data from a **Random API** using Python (e.g., `requests` library) and displays the retrieved information. Focused on **API integration** and **data parsing**. |
| **project-4-django-blog** | 📝 **Django Blog System** | The first hands-on experience with **Django Framework**, building a fully functional **Blog System** that supports creating, editing, and deleting posts. Emphasized understanding of the **MVC structure**, models, and views. |
| **project-5-database-design** | 🧮 **Database Design & ERD** | A project focused on understanding **database design**, relationships (**one-to-many**, **many-to-many**), and creating a clear **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)** to represent data structure effectively. |
